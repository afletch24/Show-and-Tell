# Show-and-Tell
This is a web application that showcases developer projects in a more visually appealing way compared to a github profile. The idea behind Show and Tell was to create a functional way for developers to display their projects to people who may not have a tech background or who are intimidated by github. Show and Tell allows the viewer to explore the each of the developer's projects by seeing an image, summary, any contributing developers, the main technologies used, as well as links to the live project and github code.
